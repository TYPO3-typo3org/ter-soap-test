# TYPO3 Extension Repository Functional Tests

Functional Tests for TYPO3 TER SOAP API.

This is work in progress. I just want to document the current state (see `git log` for when this file was updated ;) )

## Setup

 1. Checkout this extension
 2. Checkout https://github.com/czenker/Typo3ExtensionUtils.git and (IMPORTANT!) checkout the dev-2.0 branch
    and make sure to checkout the submodules
 3. maybe you have to fix the
 4. adapt config.php to your needs. Most importantly adapt the "wsdlUrl" and "extensionDownloadUrl".
 5. run "phpunit Tests/"

## TODO

Right now Typo3ExtensionUtils does not have a final API for extension uploads. So there should be more tests added.
